  "description": "## Purpose\nThis layer presents monthly traffic volumes mapped to road segments of the GIP graph and primarily serves the validation and calibration of HFLB-based mobility data using available reference measurements. This establishes a basis for further mobility analyses, correlation with EO-based environmental and air quality indicators, and spatially differentiated assessment and scenario analyses.\n\n## Data Sources\nTwo complementary datasets are used in this analysis:\n- ASFINAG Traffic Count Data (2019–2021)\nMonthly average daily traffic values (Monday–Sunday), provided as the indicator DTVMS.\nThese data are available only for road segments equipped with stationary traffic counting sensors.\n- HFLB Mobility Data (2019–2021)\nNetwork-wide mobility information based on High Frequency Location Based (HFLB) data with daily temporal resolution, covering all road segments of the high-level road network.\nTraffic volumes are represented by the variable trajectories (max) and describe relative traffic intensities.\n\n## Method\nMonthly traffic volumes from both datasets are mapped to the road segments of the GIP graph and directly compared.\nAs HFLB data do not represent absolute traffic counts, a scaling procedure is applied using ASFINAG reference measurements:\n- The monthly total traffic volume derived from the HFLB data is adjusted to match the corresponding total volume observed in the ASFINAG traffic counts.\n- The resulting scaling factor is location-independent and is applied uniformly to all road segments.\n- This process yields the variable HFLB Scaled, representing a calibrated estimate of monthly traffic volumes.\nThis approach enables a consistent calibration of HFLB data despite the limited spatial coverage and monthly temporal resolution of the reference traffic counts.\n\n## Visualization and Interaction\nThe layer visualizes monthly traffic volumes for individual road segments.\nUpon selecting a road segment on the map, time series of traffic volumes (ASFINAG DTVMS, HFLB trajectories (max), and HFLB Scaled) are displayed in a line chart.\nThis allows for direct comparison between datasets, assessment of temporal consistency and deviations, and transparent interpretation of the applied scaling procedure at segment level.",
