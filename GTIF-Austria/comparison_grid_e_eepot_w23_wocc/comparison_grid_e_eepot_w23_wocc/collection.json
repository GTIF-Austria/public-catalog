  "description": "**Comparison of grid capacities and renewable energy potentials**\n\nThis map allows for comparing applicable **energy potentials for photovoltaics (PV) and wind power** with the reported **distribution grid capacities**, depicted at the level of about 400 Austrian substation districts. Data on energy potentials include the current status (2024), realisable potentials for future years (2030 & 2040\\) and the technical potential. Reported grid data inform on the current use (booked capacity) and the available free capacities, as reported on [Verfügbare Netzanschlusskapazitäten \\- EbUtilities](https://www.ebutilities.at/verfuegbare-netzanschlusskapazitaeten) (status: 15 January 2026).\n\nThe map contains information on the following parameters: \n\n* **Grid Capacity** for corresponding substations, in MVA  \n* **Capacity (C):** Installed capacity of PV wind power plants, in MWel  \n* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by PV and wind power plants in GWhel per year\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like leap times for practical implementation, market conditions, and economic feasibility. Realisable potentials are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes **potentials without considering climate change effects** (WOCC).\n\nThe underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).\n\n[download raw C Grid compare data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_grid_potentials/comparison_grid_c_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw E Grid compare data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_grid_potentials/comparison_grid_e_EEPOT_W23.geojson)",
