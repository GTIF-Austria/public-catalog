  "description": "**Electricity Generation Technologies and their Potential**\n\nEnergy potential for **photovoltaics** **(PV)** and **wind power** for the current status (2024), realisable potentials for future years (2030 & 2040\\) and the technical potential at regional level, depicted at the level of Austrian administrative districts.\n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by PV and wind power plants in GWh<sub>el</sub> per year  \n* **Demand Share (DS):** Indicating how the annual electricity generation potential relates to electricity demand, expressing the share in corresponding final electricity demand in %.   \n* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Levelized cost per unit of generated electricity from PV and wind power plants, in EUR per MWh<sub>el</sub>  \n* **Market Value (MV):** Revenues that PV and/or wind producers may gain from selling the electricity on the wholesale electricity market, in EUR per MWh<sub>el</sub>\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like leap times for practical implementation, market conditions, and economic feasibility. For **electricity demand in 2030 and 2040** a growth of electricity consumption has been assumed that reflects decarbonisation efforts in industry, buildings and transport, causing a shift from fossil fuels towards electricity.\n\nRealisable potentials for 2030 and 2040 as well as other parameter are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes **potentials without considering climate change effects** (WOCC).\n\nThe underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).\n\n[download raw absolut electricity data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/comparison_electricity_e_absolute_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw absolut electricity data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/E_absolute_electricity.csv)\n\n\n[download raw share electricity data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/comparison_electricity_e_share_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw share electricity data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/E_demand_share_electricity.csv)\n\n[download raw MV electricity data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/comparison_electricity_mv_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw MV electricity data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/Market_value_electricity.csv)\n\n[download raw LCOE electricity data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/comparison_electricity_lcoe_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw LCOE electricity data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/LCOE_electricity.csv)\n",
