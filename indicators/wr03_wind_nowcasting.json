  "Title": "Wind Speed and Power Nowcasting",
  "Description": "The data layers *Wind Speed* and *Wind power* show the results of the nowcasting for 3 hours on 16th June 2025 from 09:00 to 12:00 UTC. The time resolution is 15min.\n\nThe data layer shows wind speed at hub height (100m above ground) in m/s. Wind speeds are extrapolated from 10m using terrain-aware logarithmic and power law methods.\n \nThe wind speed nowcasting is based on GeoSphere Austria's *INCA+* high-resolution analysis and nowcasting system. The data is provided in 15min temporal and 1000m spatial resolution. \n\nIn combination with turbine-specific power curves from *windpowerlib*, the theoretical power output for various turbine types (Enercon E-101, Vestas V90) is calculated.",
