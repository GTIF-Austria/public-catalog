  "Description": "This collection contains the snow data products generated within the framework of the Digital Twin of Alps (DTA) project. All datasets in this collection are produced using the distributed full energy balance physical model GEOtop ([Endrizzi et al., 2014](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/2831/2014/gmd-7-2831-2014.html)).\n\nWithin the GTIF Austria, these DTA products are included as legacy datasets. They serve as a foundational reference and a benchmark for comparison against the improved snow products developed within the GTIF project.",
