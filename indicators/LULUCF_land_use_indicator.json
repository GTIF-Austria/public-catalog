The scope of the Austrian Space Applications Program (ASAP 18) flagship GHG-KIT project - \"Prototyping an EO-enabled kit supporting greenhouse gas reporting\" is to develop a scientific Proof-of-Concept (PoC) towards the first European Earth Observation (EO)- integrated CO2 and CH4 Monitoring Verification and Reporting (MVR) System using Copernicus satellite data and information products, including two prototypes:\n\n1. The Verification Element based on atmospheric modelling, and\n2. LULUCF Inventory Reporter\n\nDeveloped within FFG project GHG-KIT [contract #FO999893432] https://ghg-kit.at/\n",
