  "description": "**Ambient Heat Potential for Air-Source Heat Pumps**\n\nAmbient heat potential for air-source heat pumps in Austria for current status (2023), future projection (2030 & 2040\\) and the technical potential at LAU 2 level.\n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E)**: Annual ambient heat supplied to air-source heat pumps, in GWh per year  \n* **Capacity (C)** Installed heating capacity of heat pumps, in MWth  \n* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Cost per unit of delivered heat to heating systems, in EUR per MWhth  \n* **Market Value (MV):** Reference costs of the technology in EUR per MWhth\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility.\n\nRealizable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes both **potentials without climate change effects** (WOCC) and variations under a **medium climate change scenario** (RCP4.5), referred to as MOCC.\n\nThe underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).\n\n[download raw data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/air/air_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/air_EEPOT_W23_woCC.csv)\n",
