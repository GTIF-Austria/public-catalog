  "description": "**Heating Technologies and their Potential as Share of local Heat Demand**\n\nEnergy potentials from **solar thermal energy**, **air-source heat pumps**, **aquathermal energy, ground-source heat pumps** (open and closed systems), and **excess heat** (direct utilization and utilization via heat pumps) in Austria for the current status (2023), future projections (2030 & 2040), and the technical potential at LAU 2 level.\n\nThe map contains information on **annual heat supplied to heating systems**, expressed as share of the local heat demand per year (**Energy)**\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility.\n\nRealizable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes **potentials without considering climate change effects** (WOCC).\n\nNote: Biomass is an important heat source in Austria; however, due to its high mobility and flexible\nsupply chains, it cannot be accurately allocated to individual municipalities. Therefore, biomass is not\nrepresented as a spatially resolved potential at the LAU 2 level.\n\n[download raw absolut compare data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/ambient/comparison/comparison_generated_heat_absolut_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw absolut compare data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/ambient/comparison/EEPOT_W23_generated%20heat_absolut.csv)\n\n[download raw share compare data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/ambient/comparison/comparison_generated_heat_share_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw share compare data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/ambient/comparison/EEPOT_W23_generated%20heat_share.csv)\n",
