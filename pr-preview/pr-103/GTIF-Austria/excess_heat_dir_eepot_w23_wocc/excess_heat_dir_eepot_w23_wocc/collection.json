  "description": "**Potential from Excess Heat**\n\nPotential from excess heat (direct utilization and utilization via heat pumps) in Austria as technical potential for 2030 and 2040 at the LAU 2 level. \n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E):** Annual excess heat supplied directly to heating systems (direct utilization) or annual excess heat supplied to heat pumps, in GWh per year  \n* **Capacity (C):** Installed heating capacity of heat pumps, in MWth  \n* **Market Value (MV)**: Reference costs of the technology in EUR per MWhth\n\n**Technical potential** **for 2030 and 2040** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential**, which considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility, has not been evaluated due to the lack of reliable market data.\n\nTechnical potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes potentials without considering climate change effects (WOCC).\n\nThe underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).\n\n[download raw excess heat - direct utilization  data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/ambient/excess_heat/excess_heat_dir_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw excess heat - utilization via heat pumps data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/ambient/excess_heat/excess_heat_hp_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n",
