  "description": "**Energy Potential for Hydropower**\n\nEnergy potential for hydropower for the current status (2024) and the technical potential in future years at regional level, depicted at the level of catchment areas of Austria’s river basin.\n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by hydropower in GWhel per year  \n* **Capacity (C)** Installed capacity of hydropower, in MWel  \n* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Levelized cost per unit of generated electricity from hydropower, in EUR per MWhel  \n* **Market Value (MV):** Revenues that hydropower producers may gain from selling the electricity on the wholesale electricity market, in EUR per MWhel\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. These technical potentials are provided at defined ranges, i.e., from Low to High, to reflect the underlying uncertainty in identifying the technical potentials.\n\nThe map includes potentials that **acknowledge the impact of climate change in future years (2040, 2070\\)**, assuming either **moderate climate change (RCP4.5 \\- MOCC)** or **strong climate change effects (RCP8.5 – STCC)**.\n\nThe underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).\n\n[download raw data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/hydro/hydro_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n    \n",
