  "description": "**Heat Potential from Solar Thermal Collectors**\n\nHeat potential from solar thermal collectors (ground-mounted & building-integrated collectors) in Austria for current status (2023), future projection (2030 & 2040\\) and the technical potential at LAU 2 level. \n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E)**: Annual heat supplied to heating systems, in GWh per year  \n* **Capacity (C)** Installed heating capacity, in MWth  \n* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Cost per unit of delivered heat, in EUR per MWhth  \n* **Market Value (MV):** Reference costs of the technology, in EUR per MWhth\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility.\n\nRealizable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes potentials without considering climate change effects (WOCC). \n\nThe underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).\n\n[download raw ground-mounted data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/st/st_ground_mounted/st_ground_mounted_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw ground-mounted data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/st/st_ground_mounted/st_ground_mounted_EEPOT_W23_woCC.csv)\n\n[download raw building-integrated collectors data as GeoJSON](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/st/st_buildings/st_buildings_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n[download raw building-integrated collectors data as CSV](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/st/st_buildings/st_buildings_EEPOT_W23_woCC.csv)\n",
