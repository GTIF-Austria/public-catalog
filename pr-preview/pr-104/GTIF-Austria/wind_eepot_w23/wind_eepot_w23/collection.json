  "description": "**Energy Potential for Wind**\n\nEnergy potential for wind power plants for the current status (2024), realisable potentials for future years (2030 & 2040\\) and the technical potential at regional level, depicted at the level of Austrian administrative districts.\n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by wind power plants in GWhel per year  \n* **Capacity (C)** Installed capacity of wind power plants, in MWel  \n* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Levelized cost per unit of generated electricity from wind power plants, in EUR per MWhel  \n* **Market Value (MV):** Revenues that wind producers may gain from selling the electricity on the wholesale electricity market, in EUR per MWhel\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like leap times for practical implementation, market conditions, and economic feasibility.\n\nRealisable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes **potentials without the effects of climate change (WOCC)**, with **moderate climate change (RCP4.5 \\- MOCC)** and **strong climate change effects (RCP8.5 – STCC)**.\n\nThe underlying study, “Renewable Energy Potentials in Austria for 2030 and 2040,” was conducted on behalf of the Climate and Energy Fund and was financed with appropriations from the former Federal Ministry for Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology (BMK).\n\n[download raw data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/wind/wind_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n   \n",
