  "description": "**Ambient Heat Potential from Ground-Source Heat Pumps**\n\nAmbient heat potential from ground-source heat pumps (open- and closed-systems) in Austria for current status (2023), future projection (2030 & 2040\\) and the technical potential at LAU 2 level.\n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E):** Annual ambient heat supplied to ground-source heat pumps, in GWh per year  \n* **Capacity (C)**: Installed heating capacity of heat pumps, in MWth  \n* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)**: Cost per unit of delivered heat to heating systems, in EUR per MWhth  \n* **Market Value (MV)**: Reference costs of the technology in EUR per MWhth\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential** **for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility.\n\nRealizable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes potentials without considering climate change effects (WOCC).\n\n[download raw aquifer data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/ambient/aquifer/aquifer_EEPOT_W23_woCC.geojson)\n\n[download raw closed systems data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/ambient/closed_systems/closed_systems_EEPOT_W23_woCC.geojson)\n",
