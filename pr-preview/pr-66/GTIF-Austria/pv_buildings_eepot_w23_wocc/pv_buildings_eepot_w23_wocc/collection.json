  "description": "**Energy Potential for Photovoltaic (PV)** \n\nEnergy potential for photovoltaic systems (ground-mounted, building-integrated, and total) in Austria for current status (2023 – total only), future projection (2030 & 2040\\) and the technical potential at regional level within Austria, depicted at the level of Austrian municipalities.\n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by PV, in GWhel per year  \n* **Capacity (C)** Installed capacity of PV, in MWel  \n* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Levelized cost per unit of generated electricity from PV, in EUR per MWhel  \n* **Market Value (MV):** Revenues that PV producers may gain from selling the electricity on the wholesale electricity market, in EUR per MWhel\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like leap times for practical implementation, market conditions, and economic feasibility.\n\nRealisable potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes **potentials without the effects of climate change (WOCC)**, with **moderate climate change (RCP4.5 \\- MOCC)** and **strong climate change effects (RCP8.5 – STCC)**.\n\n[download raw building-integrated data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/pv/pv_buildings/pv_buildings_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n  \n[download raw ground-mounted sealed data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/pv/pv_ground_mounted_sealed/pv_ground_mounted_sealed_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n  \n[download raw ground-mounted unsealed data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/pv/pv_ground_mounted_unsealed/pv_ground_mounted_unsealed_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n \n[download raw total data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/pv/pv_total/pv_total_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n   ",
