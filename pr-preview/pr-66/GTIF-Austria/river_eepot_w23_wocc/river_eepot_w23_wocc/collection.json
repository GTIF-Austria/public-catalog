  "description": "**Ambient Heat Potential from Flowing Water Bodies**\n\nAmbient heat potential from flowing water bodies (aquathermy) in Austria as technical potential for 2030 and 2040 at the LAU 2 level.\n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E)**: Annual ambient heat supplied to heat pumps using flowing water bodies as a source, in GWh per year  \n* **Capacity (C)** Installed heating capacity of heat pumps, in MWth  \n* **Market Value (MV):** Reference costs of the technology in EUR per MWhth\n\n**Technical potential for 2030 and 2040** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential,** which considers practical barriers like implementation timing, market conditions, and economic feasibility, **has not been evaluated due to the lack of reliable market data**.\n\nTechnical potential for 2030 and 2040 are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes potentials without considering climate change effects (WOCC). \n\n[download raw data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/hydro/hydro_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n\n",
