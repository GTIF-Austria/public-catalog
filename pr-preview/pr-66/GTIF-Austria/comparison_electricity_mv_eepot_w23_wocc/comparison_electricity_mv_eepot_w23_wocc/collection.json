  "description": "**Electricity Generation Technologies and their Potential**\n\nEnergy potential for **photovoltaics** **(PV)** and **wind power** for the current status (2024), realisable potentials for future years (2030 & 2040\\) and the technical potential at regional level, depicted at the level of Austrian administrative districts.\n\nThe map contains information on following parameters: \n\n* **Energy (E)**: Annual electricity generated by PV and wind power plants in GWhel per year  \n* **Demand Share (DS):** Indicating how the annual electricity generation potential relates to electricity demand, expressing the share in corresponding final electricity demand in %.   \n* **Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE):** Levelized cost per unit of generated electricity from PV and wind power plants, in EUR per MWhel  \n* **Market Value (MV):** Revenues that PV and/or wind producers may gain from selling the electricity on the wholesale electricity market, in EUR per MWhel\n\n**Technical potential** represents the maximum energy flow under physical and technical constraints, such as efficiency and spatial limitations. **Realisable potential for 2030 and 2040** considers practical barriers like leap times for practical implementation, market conditions, and economic feasibility. For **electricity demand in 2030 and 2040** a growth of electricity consumption has been assumed that reflects decarbonisation efforts in industry, buildings and transport, causing a shift from fossil fuels towards electricity.\n\nRealisable potentials for 2030 and 2040 as well as other parameter are provided with defined ranges: ***Low*** (conservative and less ambitious), ***Medium*** (realistic with a high likelihood of occurrence) and ***High*** (optimistic and ambitious).\n\nThe map includes **potentials without considering climate change effects** (WOCC).\n\n\n[download raw absolut electricity data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/comparison_electricity_e_absolute_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n    \n\n[download raw share electricity data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/comparison_electricity_e_share_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n    \n\n[download raw MV electricity data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/comparison_electricity_mv_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n    \n\n[download raw LCOE electricity data](https://workspace-ui-public.gtif-austria.hub-otc.eox.at/api/public/share/public-4wazei3y-02/KLIEN-studie/comparison_electricity/comparison_electricity_lcoe_EEPOT_W23.geojson)\n     \n",
