  "Description": "## Thermal Diffusivity Model\nThe thermal diffusivity is a measure that represents how fast heat diffuses through the soil. It is measured as mm2/sec. The model was calculated using remote sensing data  (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-3) and interpolated ground data  (bulk density, soil texture, slope DEM, organic content, land use map, natura2000) by applying a model of water distribution to the first meter of the soil profile. The thermal diffusivity layer was calculated for the whole Austria for the 2024.\n",
