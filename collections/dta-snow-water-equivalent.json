  "Title": "Digital Twin Alps: Snow products",
  "Description": "This collection contains the snow data products generated by [Waterjade Srl](https://waterjade.com/en/homepage/) within the framework of the Digital Twin of Alps (DTA) project. All datasets in this collection are produced using the distributed full energy balance physical model GEOtop ([Endrizzi et al., 2014](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/2831/2014/gmd-7-2831-2014.html)).\n\nWithin the GTIF Austria, these DTA products are included as legacy datasets. They serve as a foundational reference and a benchmark for comparison against the improved snow products developed within the GTIF project.\n\nThe Digital Twin of Alps activity was part of ESA's Regional Initiative 3, which paves the way towards a new representation of the Earth System based on the integration of Earth Observation data, inter-connected numerical simulations, and Artificial Intelligence.",
