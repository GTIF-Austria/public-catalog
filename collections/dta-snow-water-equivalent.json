  "Title": "Snow Water Equivalent",
  "Description": "**Snow Water Equivalent**: in mm, is the depth of water that would result if the snow mass melted completely ([Fierz et al., 2009](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000186462)).  This is the precursor product (produced in the framework of the [Digital Twin of Alps](https://digitaltwinalps.com/) project) for SWE, serving as a reference dataset. Within the scope of the GTIF Austria, this daily dataset, based on the distributed full energy balance physical model GEOtop ([Endrizzi et al., 2014](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/7/2831/2014/gmd-7-2831-2014.html)), has been improved to account for snow observations.
