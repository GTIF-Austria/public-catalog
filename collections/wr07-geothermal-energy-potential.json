  "Description": "# Thermal Conductivity \n The ability of a ground to conduct heat from one location to another without the movement of the soil conducting the heat. It is expressed in watts per meter kelvin (W/mK). And it was calculated using remote sensing data  (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-3) and interpolated ground data  (bulk density, soil texture, slope DEM, organic content, land use map, natura2000) by applying a model of water distribution to the first meter of the soil profile. The thermal conductivity layer was calculated for the whole Austria for the year 2024.",
