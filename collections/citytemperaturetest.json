  "Title": "City temperature forecast test",
  "Description": "By integrating precise satellite-based data, air temperature (and derived variables) can be calculated on a 100-meter grid to simulate and forecast their spatial and hourly variations providing a database for informed decision-making. The model integrates multiple high-resolution datasets to enhance forecast accuracy:\n› Satellite-based land cover data (e.g., Sentinel-2) to map surface properties and urban structures.\n› Building density and surface material analysis to account for urban heat storage and emission.\n› Vegetation and green space influence to assess cooling effects from parks and tree canopies.\n› Anthropogenic heat emissions from industry and residential heating/cooling.\n\ntechnical features\nspatial gridding\t100m\ntemporal gridding\t1 hour\nforecast range\t+30 hours\nforecast time\t00 UTC",
